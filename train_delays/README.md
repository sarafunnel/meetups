PyLadies Train Delays

The application makes a call to Trafikverket's api, removes cancelled trains 
and presents the average delay per day from Stockholm Central Station 
in a much loved graph. 

Management have decided that the organisation should no longer use Pandas. This needs 
to be removed in a safe way, making sure that none of the business critical 
functionality of the application is lost.
